Training phase:
$ run_all.sh # runs training scripts {new_cpu.sh, new_gpu.sh} -> makes energywrapper/ocl/output
Training scripts are coded to run 393 different configurations (i.e., the combinations of freqind, memctrl, ncpus or WG sizes for GPUs).
The scripts take no arguments, users may add or remove configs/inputs as they see fit.

Formaters:
$ ./leo_fmt.sh # will take data in energywrapper/ocl/output and format them for leo in energywrapper/ocl/leo_data
$ ./excel_fmt.sh # will format everything so that it can be easily imported to excel

Example testing phase:
# ./bench_cpu.sh <ocl kernel & exe path> <exe_base_name> <exe argument> <bench_name>. E.g:
$ ./run_output_bench.sh ../../particlefilter OCL_particlefilter_double "-x 128 -y 128 -z 1000 -np 10000" 128_1000_10000_t1
Assumes the names are OCL_particlefilter_double_cpu / OCL_particlefilter_double_gpu
Now appended (global) data will be in energywrapper/ocl/output_bench/128_1000/10000_t1/

energywrapper/ocl/output_bench/128_1000/10000_t1/ now contains data that fits Leo (appended tables are outside CPU and GPU folders.

To run with final application stored ./out.txt:
./run_final.sh ./test_final.txt ../../particlefilter OCL_particlefilter_double "-x 128 -y 128 -z 10 -np 1000" ./out.txt
